# Nationwider
### A mapping program for the nationwide community, created in the hopes of an alternative to "The powder toy".

Created using Arcade 3.0.0+ with Python3.13.2 

This version of the program is created for a specific use case within a nationwide game. I will most likely create an alternative version that is more general use case and will have some extra features that a nationwide community might use.
