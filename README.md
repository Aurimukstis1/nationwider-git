# Nationwider - Python
## A map tool for the Licinius nationwide community

Created in Python 3.13.7,
Utilizing Arcade 3.2+ for *Graphics*
Utilizing Amazon S3 for *Online Saving*

*Note.* This program is the first proof-of-concept iteration of Nationwider, designed for specific use within the "Galaina" nationwide game hosted by Licinius/Minecrafttranquility, if you are not part of this community, you will most likely not find this project of any use and it's uses will most likely not work for you.

A rewrite and redesign of this mapping tool is being done in C++ for more compatibility and better performance.
Moreover, the redesign would give the ability for anyone to host their own nationwides, so feel free to check back to find out if the project is done.
