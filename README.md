# Nationwider-git (Galaina)
### A mapping program for the "Galaina" nationwide community, created in the hopes of an alternative to "The powder toy".

Created using Arcade 3.2+ with Python 3.13.2
Functionality for Amazon AWS s3 buckets for online save sharing

*Note.* This version of the program is created for a specific use case within a nationwide game. 
I will most likely create an alternative version that is more general use case and will have some extra features 
that a more general nationwide community might use. This is, afterall, a proof of concept.
